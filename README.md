# TCG-RSVP-App
This is a Reactjs TCG RSVP App. It  should be able to  view a list of TCG events ordered by Event DateTime and have a button to RSVP to a specific event.
After clicking on the RSVP button, a modal dialog should be loaded allowing a student to capture their personal details
(Name Surname, Email address, Dietary Requirements). RSVPs must saved to mongodb instance. 
My front-end should separate from my  API code and  be able to run my api and front-end separately.
